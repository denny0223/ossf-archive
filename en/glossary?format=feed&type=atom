		<summary type="html">When we talk about free software, one of the issues that most often get discussed is whether it is possible to integrate free software with non-free ones. The original GNU GPL, with the goal in mind that free software should always be free, does not allow the integration of free software with non-free ones, except in the sole case when such integration is only a simple aggregation. This is designed to prevent free software from becoming non-free software after such integration and hence making it no longer free. Many licenses after the GPL do not necessarily impose such restrictions. Some of them even have relatively relaxed requirements in the hope that free software can take a bigger market share and the idea of free software can be more widespread. Different licenses have usually different, detailed terms on this. Issue of compatibility, integration and combination is not limited to the interaction between two free software programs. Such issue also exists between free and non-free software programs. The derivative work that results from the two programs brings forth issues such as the choice of license terms and compatibility. For example, if programs A and B are licensed under licenses A&amp;rsquo; and B&amp;rsquo; respectively, and programs A and B are combined into the program C. Because program C is the derivative work of both programs A and B, C is bound to the terms of A&amp;rsquo; and B&amp;rsquo;. If A&amp;rsquo; and B&amp;rsquo; are not compatible, the effectiveness of the integration of A and B will be affected. For detailed discussion, please refer to the section &amp;ldquo;Compatibility&amp;rdquo;. </summary>

		<summary type="html">The copyright holder may grant a third person the right to use his or her own work. The territory, duration, content, means of such use and other related issue may be decided in the agreement between the copyright holder and the licensee. For example, an author can grant a publisher the right to reprint his or her own work in a given quantity and to sell the reprinted book in a certain area within three years. This means the two parties can agree on terms they set up. If the licensee grants the rights obtained to a third party, this is called sublicensing. The two parties in a sublicensing agreement are the party that sublicenses and the third party, and the sublicensing terms must be within the rights obtained by the licensee. To put it in simple terms, sublicensing means the licensee grants in the role of the rights holder the rights that he or she has obtained to a third party. What is to be noted, however, is that the sublicensing model is not the normal in the Copyright Law cases. Therefore, if in a license the terms do not explicitly permit sublicensing, sublicensing is in legal terms seen as not allowed. Sublicensing is possible whether the rights are granted exclusively or non-exclusively. The difference is that in the latter case the licensee is required to have the copyright holder&amp;rsquo;s consent. In the case of exclusive licensing, the licensee assumes the legal role of licensor. If the agreement does not specify that no sublicensing is allowed, the licensee can decide on his or her own whether he or she wants to grant the rights to a third party. In terms of free software licenses, almost all licenses are non-exclusive ones. Some licenses, such as the MIT License, the MPL or the CPL, explicitly specify that the licensee may sublicense, so that the act of sublicensing does not require the consent of the author of the original work, thus giving users more flexibility in the use of a software program. </summary>

		<summary type="html">Royalty is the price paid by the licensee. The sum of the price, the way it is paid, and other details are agreed by the parties involved. In intellectual property licensing terms (patent, trademark, copyright), the payment of royalty is seen as the compensation of a work that is the fruit of a person&amp;rsquo;s intellectual efforts and is therefore a crucial part of the terms. For example, patent royalty usually takes a certain percentage of the revenue or the profit of sales generated on the licensee&amp;rsquo;s side. To afford this expenditure, the licensee will have to exercise control on and make use of the rights obtained. If the licensee sublicenses the rights to a third party, this is done for the sake of marketing or profitability, not on the intention to promote such patented technology. Royalty also applies to copyrighted works such as printed works and computer programs. Free software means openness and sharing, and in terms of these concepts, licensing here means an expectation that the user can make the best use of the original work. It is not in the intention of such licenses that any charge of royalty would restrain the licensee&amp;rsquo;s willingness to further distribute the work. This is why almost every free software license would claim that it is royalty-free. Some licenses allows the licensee to charge a third party a fee higher than the cost of distributing the work, but this does not equal to the royalty charged by the copyright holder. The major difference, between a royalty and a fee higher than the cost of distribution, lies in that the royalty is not a one-time fee. It can be charged like tax, i.e. it can be charged according to the duration of use, subject of use, or any other conditions and can occur more than one time. The collection of royalty can be flexibly changed and is always effective on the licensee. The fee that is higher than the cost of distribution is one-time in nature. Although it has the same appearance for a charge, but it does have a completely different meaning. </summary>

Because of this, the copyright holder&amp;rsquo;s consent must be obtained before a work can be translated, instrumentalized, rewritten, shot as film or be modified into another work. Modification in terms of computer programming belongs to the above category of modifying a work. When a programmer modifies other people&amp;rsquo;s program, he or she can specify that the modification is combined into the original work, thus making the modified work a derivative work (see &amp;ldquo;derivative work&amp;rdquo;).

This is because if the patch file does not include the source code of the original program, it can be seen as an independent work, rather than as the derivate work of the original work. In most free software licenses, the copyright holder usually grants the licensee the right of modifying the program and distributing the modified program.

This may cause disadvantages to the social goods or the development of knowledge and technology. In free software licenses, therefore, licensors will explicitly express that the terms are not exclusive, so that the rights can be granted to different people at the same time. Exclusive license is a closed, excluding relationship made with a specific person or under specific premises and excludes non-licensees from using the work. Non-exclusive licenses, on the other hand, can grant rights to unspecified number of people. Free software programs must therefore be licensed under non-exclusive terms. &lt;br /&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">A copyright holder can set up different licensing terms for different licensees. On the other hand, if the copyright holder has agreed in a license that certain or all rights are granted to a licensee in a certain period and that the rights will not be granted to others during such period of the time, this license is said to be an exclusive license. When the licensor adopts an exclusive license, he or she will not be able to grant the specified rights to other people. The copyright holder himself or herself may also not be able to exercise the rights granted to the licensee. If no such excluding clauses appear in a license, such is said to be a non-exclusive license. Under exclusive license, as the copyright holder grants rights to a single party, the work may not be fully made use of. This may cause disadvantages to the social goods or the development of knowledge and technology. In free software licenses, therefore, licensors will explicitly express that the terms are not exclusive, so that the rights can be granted to different people at the same time. Exclusive license is a closed, excluding relationship made with a specific person or under specific premises and excludes non-licensees from using the work. Non-exclusive licenses, on the other hand, can grant rights to unspecified number of people. Free software programs must therefore be licensed under non-exclusive terms. &lt;br /&gt;</content>
