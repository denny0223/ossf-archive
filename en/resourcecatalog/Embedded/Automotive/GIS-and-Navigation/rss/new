	<title>RoadMap</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/en/resourcecatalog/Embedded/Automotive/GIS-and-Navigation/roadmap</link>
	<description><![CDATA[RoadMap is a program that supports car navigation: It displays a map of the streets, tracks the position provided by a NMEA-compliant GPS receiver, identifies the street matching the position and announces the name of the crossing street at the next intersection. A rudimentary trip feature allows RoadMap to display some basic navigation information (distance to the destination, direction, speed, etc.). Voice messages are generated that duplicate some of the screen information. RoadMap is written in C, runs on Linux and Unix, iPAQ and Zaurus. It is released under GPL license.]]></description>
