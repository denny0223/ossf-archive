	<description><![CDATA[The fully-functional stack is over 25 programs and libraries, each requiring custom configuration, and taking days of effort. The complexity of this process has been the subject of many emails to the MapServer mailing list and others. <br /> HostGIS Linux filled its position well. In 15 minutes, you could have a freshly-installed OS with the MapServer stack and a set of a working examples using GDAL/OGR, PostGIS, OpenLayers and TileCache. This saved literally days of effort over figuring out the installation process on your own platform.]]></description>

	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/tw/resourcecatalog/GIS/Geospatial-Open-Source-Project/Crisis-Management/ushahidi</link>
	<description><![CDATA[The <strong><span class="reference external">Ushahidi</span></strong> Engine is a free and open source platform that allows anyone to gather distributed data via SMS, email or web and visualize it on a map or a timeline. Ushahidi’s goal is to create tools for democratizing information, increasing transparency and lowering the barriers for individuals to share their stories.<br /><br />Ushahidi, which means “testimony” in Swahili, was initially developed to map reports of violence in Kenya after the post-election fallout at the beginning of 2008. Ushahidi’s roots are in the collaboration of Kenyan citizen journalists during a time of crisis. The website was used to map incidents of violence and peace efforts throughout the country based on reports submitted via the web and mobile phone. This initial deployment of Ushahidi had 45,000 users in Kenya, and was the catalyst for us realizing there was a need for a platform based on it, which could be use by others around the world.<br /><br /><strong>License：</strong>GPL-3.0<br /> <span style="color: #808080;" 808080=""><em><span style="color: #808080;"><em>The project description quoted above is licensed by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://live.osgeo.org/en/overview/ushahidi_overview.html"><span style="color: #808080; text-decoration: underline;">OSGeo</span></a></span> under a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"><span style="color: #808080; text-decoration: underline;">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</span></a></span>。</em></span></em></span>]]></description>

	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/tw/resourcecatalog/GIS/Geospatial-Open-Source-Project/Crisis-Management/sahana-eden</link>
	<description><![CDATA[<strong>Sahana Eden</strong> is a Family of Applications to Help You Help Others. It provides web based collaboration tools that addresses the common coordination problems faced during a disaster including finding missing people, managing aid, managing volunteers, and tracking camps effectively between Government groups, the civil society (NGOs) and the victims themselves.<br /><br /> Solutions are available for Disaster Management, Emergency Management, Development, Humanitarian and Environmental sectors. Free and Open Source means that it is easily Customisable and Extensible. Sahana Eden is also able to integrate with other solutions and can provide a management/ticketing interface around crowd-sourced data - such as that collected in the Ushahidi incident mapping application.<br /><br /> The Sahana project was initiated by volunteers in the Sri Lankan FOSS development community to help their fellow countrymen and countrywomen affected during the 2004 Asian Tsunami in December 2004. The system was officially used by the Government of Sri Lanka and the system was released as Free and Open Source software. Subsequently a re-write as a generic disaster management tools was incubated with the sponsorship of the Swedish International Development Agency, IBM, the US National Science Foundation and it has been used by dozens of Governments and NGOs since then.<br /><br /><strong>License</strong>：MIT<br /><span style="color: #808080;"><em>The project description quoted above is licensed by <a href="https://live.osgeo.org/en/overview/sahana_overview.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #808080; text-decoration: underline;">OSGeo</span></span></a> under a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"><span style="color: #808080; text-decoration: underline;">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</span></a></span>。</em></span>]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<strong>libLAS</strong> is a C/C++ library for reading and writing the very common <cite>LAS</cite> <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIDAR">LiDAR</a> format. The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.asprs.org/society/committees/standards/lidar_exchange_format.html">ASPRS LAS format</a> is a sequential binary format used to store data from LiDAR sensors and by LiDAR processing software for data interchange and archival.<br /><br />LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a form of high precision range detection much like a radar system that uses laser light as the electromagnetic emission. One of LiDAR systems’ products is a “point cloud” data product that can be conceptualized as a series of point measurements representing distance from the sensor to a returned emission. A common storage format for these point cloud data is ASPRS LAS format.<br /><br /><strong>Licence:</strong> BSD<br /><span style="color: #808080;"><em>The page content listed below is licensed by <a href="https://live.osgeo.org/en/overview/liblas_overview.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #808080; text-decoration: underline;" class="il">OSGeo</span></span></a> under a<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"><span style="color: #808080; text-decoration: underline;">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</span></a></span>。</em></span>]]></description>
