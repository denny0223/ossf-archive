	<description><![CDATA[The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international industry consortium of <strong>437</strong> companies, government agencies and universities participating in a consensus process to develop publicly available interface standards. <a href="https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/">OGC® Standards</a> support interoperable solutions that "geo-enable" the Web, wireless and location-based services and mainstream IT. The standards empower technology developers to make complex spatial information and services accessible and useful with all kinds of applications. <br /><br /> OGC® and OpenGIS® are registered trademarks of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). OGC is the brand name associated with the standards and documents produced by the OGC. OGC standards are developed in a unique consensus process supported by the OGC's industry, government and academic members to enable geoprocessing technologies to interoperate, or "plug and play". You will also find the OGC trademark associated with products that implement our standards and that have obtained the <a href="https://www.opengeospatial.org/compliance">Certified OGC Compliant</a> brand. Make sure that your geoprocessing and location services procurement and technology development programs demand OGC standards!]]></description>
