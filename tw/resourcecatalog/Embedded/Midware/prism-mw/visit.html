						<p align="left"><b>Welcome to the Prism-MW homepage.</b>  PrismMW is an extensible middleware platform 
						that enables efficient implementation, deployment, and execution of distributed software systems in terms 
						of their architectural elements: components, connectors, configurations, and events.<br><br></p>
						
						<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Benefits</font></b></p>
						
						<p>Prism-MW is a middleware targeted at applications in highly distributed, resource constrained, heterogeneous, and 
						mobile settings. The key properties of Prism-MW are its native, and flexible, support for architectural abstractions 
						(including architectural styles), efficiency, scalability, and extensibility. These properties are enabled by Prism-MW’s 
						extensive separation of concerns that spans several dimensions:
						
						<ul>
							<li>By adopting an explicit architectural perspective, Prism-MW has inherited the separation of computation (handled by components) 
							from interaction (handled by ports and connectors) intrinsic to software architectures.</li>
							
							<li>By providing a simple mechanism for supporting multiple architectural styles (possibly in a single application), Prism-MW allows 
							system developers to separate cleanly a system’s design from its implementation; Prism-MW’s style extensions automatically ensure all 
							relevant architectural relationships and properties.</li>
							
							<li>Prism-MW’s extensive use of abstract classes and interfaces, as well as minimized dependencies among its classes, allow tailoring 
							implementation-level concerns (e.g., the ability to select different schedulers independently of dispatchers or to compose distribution, 
							XML encoding, and compression facilities for network-based interactions).</li>
							
							<li>Finally, Prism-MW completely separates an application’s conceptual architecture from its realization. For example, each component 
							in an architecture may be implemented in multiple PLs; those implementations are fully interchangeable if ExtensiblePorts with the appropriate 
							implementations of the AbstractXMLConversion class are used.</li>
							
						</ul>

						<p align="center"><b>UML Class Diagram of PrismMW. Middleware core classes are in gray and dark gray.</b></p>
						
						<p>A distributed system implemented in Prism-MW consists of
						a number of <b>Architecture</b> objects, each of which serves as a
						container for a single subsystem and delimits an address
						space. <b>Components</b> within and across the different Architecture
						objects interact by exchanging <b>Events</b>. The default
						implementation of Prism-MW uses a circular array for
						storing all events in a single address space. This allowed us
						to optimize event processing by introducing a pool of
						shepherd threads to handle events sent by any
						component in a given address space. The size of the thread
						pool is adjustable. Since the event queue is of a fixed size
						(determined at system construction-time), we also use a
						producer-consumer algorithm to keep event production
						under control and supply shepherd threads with a constant
						stream of events to process.<br><br></p>
