	<title>WorldView-2</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/tw/resourcecatalog/GIS/Remote-Sensing/worldview-2</link>
	<description><![CDATA[<strong> WorldView-2</strong> is able to act like a paintbrush, sweeping back and forth to collect very large areas of multispectral imagery in a single pass. WorldView-2 alone is able to collect nearly 1 million km<sup>2</sup> every day, doubling the collection capacity of our constellation to nearly 2 million km<sup>2</sup> per day. And the combination of WorldView-2’s increased agility and high altitude enables it to typically revisit any place on earth in 1.1 days. When added to the satellite constellation, revisit time drops below one day and never exceeds two days, providing the most same-day passes of any commercial high resolution constellation.]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<strong>WorldView-1</strong>, DigitalGlobe's earth imaging satellite, completed a successful launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, U.S.A., at 11:35 Hrs Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) on September 18th, 2007. The Delta II rocket lifted off in good weather and the WorldView-1 satellite is "currently undergoing a calibration and check-out period," according to DigitalGlobe. The first panchromatic image data should become available before October 18th, 2007.]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[The <strong>RapidEye</strong> constellation of five satellites stands apart from other providers of satellite-based geospatial information in their unique ability to acquire high-resolution, large-area image data on a daily basis. The RapidEye system collects an unprecedented 4 million square kilometers of data per day at 6.5 meter nominal ground resolution. Each satellite measures less than one cubic meter and weighs 150 kg (bus + payload), and has been designed for at least a seven-year mission life. All five satellites are equipped with identical sensors and are located in the same orbital plane. RapidEye's satellites include the Red-Edge band, which is sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content.]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<strong>Pleiades-1</strong> satellite is the first very high-resolution satellite from SPOT. The satellite is capable of providing <a href="https://www.satimagingcorp.com/svc/orthorectification.html">orthorectified</a> color data at 0.5-meter resolution (roughly comparable to <a href="https://www.satimagingcorp.com/satellite-sensors/geoeye-1.html">GeoEye-1</a>) and revisiting any point on Earth as it covers a total of 1 million square kilometers (approximately 386,102 square miles) daily. Perhaps most importantly, Pleiades-1 is capable of acquiring high-resolution stereo imagery in just one pass, and can accommodate large areas (up to 1,000 km x 1,000 km).]]></description>

	<title>LANDSAT 7</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/tw/resourcecatalog/GIS/Remote-Sensing/landsat-7</link>
	<description><![CDATA[In 1992, the US Congress authorized the procurement, launch and operation of a new Landsat satellite. This new system, Landsat 7, is now under construction and is scheduled for launch in April, 1999. It will be the latest in a series of earth observation satellites dating back to 1972. The twenty-two year record of data acquired by the Landsat satellites constitutes the longest continuous record of the earth's continental surfaces. Preservation of the existing record and continuation of the Landsat capability were identified in the law as critical to land surface monitoring and global change research.]]></description>
