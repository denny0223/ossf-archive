	<title>Open GeoSMS Standard - Core</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/tw/resourcecatalog/GIS/Standards/open-geosms-standard-core-</link>
	<description><![CDATA[The OGC Open GeoSMS Standard provides developers with an extended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS">Short Message Service (SMS)</a> encoding and interface to facilitate communication of location content between different LBS (Location-Based Service) devices or applications. SMS is the open text communication service standard most commonly used in phone, web and mobile communication systems for the exchange of short text messages between fixed line or mobile phone devices. The lightweight and easy to implement Open GeoSMS Standard facilitates interoperability between mobile applications and the rapidly expanding world of geospatial applications and services that implement OGC standard interfaces, encodings and best practices.]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[The<strong> Sensor Web Enablement (SWE)</strong> Common Data Model Encoding Standard defines low level data models for exchanging sensor related data between nodes of the OGC® Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework. These models allow applications and/or servers to structure, encode and transmit sensor datasets in a self describing and semantically enabled way.]]></description>

	<title>Geography Markup Language ( GML )</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/tw/resourcecatalog/GIS/Standards/geography-markup-language-</link>
	<description><![CDATA[The OpenGIS® Geography Markup Language Encoding Standard (GML) The Geography Markup Language (GML) is an XML grammar for expressing geographical features. GML serves as a modeling language for geographic systems as well as an open interchange format for geographic transactions on the Internet. As with most XML based grammars, there are two parts to the grammar – the schema that describes the document and the instance document that contains the actual data. A GML document is described using a GML Schema. This allows users and developers to describe generic geographic data sets that contain points, lines and polygons. However, the developers of GML envision communities working to define community-specific application schemas [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GML_Application_Schemas] that are specialized extensions of GML. Using application schemas, users can refer to roads, highways, and bridges instead of points, lines and polygons. If everyone in a community agrees to use the same schemas they can exchange data easily and be sure that a road is still a road when they view it. Clients and servers with interfaces that implement the OpenGIS® Web Feature Service Interface Standard[<a href="https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs">https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs</a>] read and write GML data. GML is also an ISO standard (ISO 19136:2007) [<a href="https://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=32554">www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=32554</a> ]. See also the GML pages on OGC Network: <a href="https://www.ogcnetwork.net/gml">https://www.ogcnetwork.net/gml</a> .]]></description>

	<title>Web Map Service ( WMS )</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/tw/resourcecatalog/GIS/Standards/web-map-service-</link>
	<description><![CDATA[The OpenGIS® Web Map Service Interface Standard (WMS) provides a simple HTTP interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed geospatial databases. A WMS request defines the geographic layer(s) and area of interest to be processed. The response to the request is one or more geo-registered map images (returned as JPEG, PNG, etc) that can be displayed in a browser application. The interface also supports the ability to specify whether the returned images should be transparent so that layers from multiple servers can be combined or not.]]></description>

	<title>Keyhole Markup Language ( KML )</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/tw/resourcecatalog/GIS/Standards/keyhole-markup-language</link>
	<description><![CDATA[Google submitted KML (formerly Keyhole Markup Language) to the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to be evolved within the OGC consensus process with the following goal: KML Version 2.2 has been adopted as an OGC implementation standard. Future versions may be harmonized with relevant OGC standards that comprise the OGC standards baseline. There are four objectives for this standards work: <br /><br />
<ul>
<li>That there be one international standard language for expressing geographic annotation and visualization on existing or future web-based online and mobile maps (2d) and earth browsers (3d).</li>
<li>That KML be aligned with international best practices and standards, thereby enabling greater uptake and interoperability of earth browser implementations.</li>
<li>That the OGC and Google will work collaboratively to ensure that the KML implementer community is properly engaged in the process and that the KML community is kept informed of progress and issues.</li>
<li>That the OGC process will be used to ensure proper life-cycle management of the KML Standard, including such issues as backwards compatibility.</li>
</ul>]]></description>

	<title>Web Processing Service ( WPS )</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/tw/resourcecatalog/GIS/Standards/web-processing-service--wps-</link>
	<description><![CDATA[The OpenGIS® Web Processing Service (WPS) Interface Standard provides rules for standardizing how inputs and outputs (requests and responses) for geospatial processing services, such as polygon overlay. The standard also defines how a client can request the execution of a process, and how the output from the process is handled. It defines an interface that facilitates the publishing of geospatial processes and clients’ discovery of and binding to those processes. The data required by the WPS can be delivered across a network or they can be available at the server.]]></description>

	<title>Web Feature Service ( WFS )</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/tw/resourcecatalog/GIS/Standards/web-feature-service--wfs-</link>
	<description><![CDATA[The Open Geospatial Consortium <b>Web Feature Service</b> Interface Standard (<b>WFS</b>) provides an <span class="mw-redirect">interface</span> allowing requests for geographical features across the web using platform-independent calls. One can think of geographical features as the "source code" behind a map, whereas the WMS interface or online mapping portals like Google Maps return only an image, which end-users cannot edit or spatially analyze. The XML-based GML furnishes the default payload-encoding for transporting the geographic features, but other formats like shapefiles can also serve for transport. In early 2006, the OGC members approved the OpenGIS GML Simple Features Profile. This profile is designed to both increase interoperability between WFS servers and to improve the ease of implementation of the WFS standard.]]></description>
