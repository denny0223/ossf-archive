<h2>What is WebInject?</h2>
<p>
WebInject is a free tool for automated testing of web applications and web services.  It can be used to test 
individual system components that have HTTP interfaces (JSP, ASP, CGI, PHP, AJAX, Servlets, HTML Forms, XML/SOAP Web Services, REST, etc), 
and can be used as a test harness to create a suite of [HTTP level] automated functional, acceptance, and 
regression tests.  A test harness allows you to run 
many test cases and collect/report your results.  WebInject offers real-time results display and may also 
be used for monitoring system response times.
</p>
<p>
WebInject can be used as a complete test framework that is controlled by the WebInject User Interface (GUI).  
Optionally, it can be used as a standalone test runner (text/console application) which can be integrated and 
called from other test frameworks or applications.
</p>


<h2>Programming Language and Platforms</h2>
<p>
WebInject uses an XML API for defining and loading test cases.  You can use WebInject without ever seeing its 
internal implementation.
</p>
<p>
WebInject is written in Perl and can run on any platform that a Perl interpreter can be 
installed on (MS Windows, GNU/Linux, BSD, Solaris, MAC OS, and many more).  Currently, 
binary executables of WebInject are only available for MS Windows.  If you would like to 
run on other platforms, you must have a Perl interpreter and run it from the Perl source 
code.</p>


<h2>Test Cases</h2>
<p>Test cases are written in XML files, using XML elements and attributes, and passed to the WebInject 
engine for execution against the application/service under test.  This abstracts the internals 
of WebInject's implementation away from the non-technical tester, while using an open 
architecture [written in Perl] for those that require more customization or modifications.
</p>

<h2>Results/Reporting</h2>
<p>
Result reports are generated in HTML (for viewing) and XML (for tranformation by external programs).  
These detailed results include pass/fail status, errors, response times, etc.  Results are also 
displayed in a window on the User Interface if you are running the WebInject GUI, and are sent
to the STDOUT channel if you are running the WebInject Engine as a standalone (console) application.
</p>

<h2>Service-Level Monitoring</h2>
<p>
HTTP response times can be collected and monitored in real-time during test execution.  Timer statistics are 
calculated and displayed in a monitor window during runtime.  When used along with gnuplot (a plotting utility),
a response time graph is generated and updated in real-time as the test runs.  This is used to verify responses
from the web application or web service under test are within an acceptable range (to meet your SLA or quality of 
service criteria).  This also enables WebInject to be run as a performance probe for application/service monitoring.
</p>
<p>
WebInject can also be integrated as a plugin for external monitoring systems.  In this case, it is used in
console mode as an intelligent test agent that returns status and response times to your external program.  
</p>
<p>
For real-time monitoring of your web applications or web services, WebInject is able to run in a mode that makes 
it compatible with Nagios. Nagios is an open source host, service, and network monitoring program.
</p>
<p>
For graphical trending of web service-levels over a long period of time, WebInject is able to run in a mode that 
makes it compatible with MRTG.  MRTG (Multi Router Traffic Grapher) is an open source tool for collecting, storing, 
and graphing time-series data.
