	<title>RubyScript2Exe</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/tw/resourcecatalog/Program-Development/Programming-Languages/ruby/Compiler/rubyscript2exe</link>
	<description><![CDATA[<p>
<p>RubyScript2Exe transforms your Ruby application into a standalone, compressed Windows, Linux or Mac OS X (Darwin) executable. You can look at it as a "compiler". Not in the sense of a source-code-to-byte-code compiler, but as a "collector", for it collects all necessary files to run your application on an other machine: the Ruby application,the Ruby interpreter and the Ruby runtime library (stripped down for your application). Anyway, the result is the same: a standalone executable (application.exe).And that's what we want!</p>

	<title>Walrus</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/tw/resourcecatalog/Program-Development/Programming-Languages/ruby/Compiler/walrus</link>
	<description><![CDATA[<p>
<p>Walrus is a free Object-Oriented templating engine written in Ruby and licensed under the GPL. Plain text templates are compiled down to Ruby code; final output is produced by executing ("filling") the compiled templates.</p>
<p>Walrus also comes with a packet parser generator for recognizing Parsing Expression Grammars, and a comhttps://test-unit.rubyforge.org/#test-unit-installmand line tool to make compiling and filling templates easy. Walrus includes a sophisticated parser generator that can make packet parsers capable of recognizing Parsing Expression Grammars (including grammars that include left-recursion), and outputting arbitrarily complex Abstract Syntax Trees.</p>
<p>Walrus was inspired by the Cheetah template engine written in Python.</p>
<p>Platform:MAC OS X   License:GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>
<p>XRuby is the first Ruby to Java compiler which compiles Ruby source code (.rb) to Java bytecode (.class). The parser is implemented in ANTLR, and ASM has been used to emit Java bytecode.</p>
<p>XRuby is able to pass all tests in samples/test.rb and most unit tests in test/ruby/ - a decent test suite that comes with Ruby installation. In most benchmark tests, XRuby runs faster than Ruby 1.8.5.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>
<p>RubyMake is a Make system based on Ruby that offers a cross platform interface for compilation, assemblages, software packings.</p>
<p>RubyMake aims to be a replacement for compilers like SCons and AAP.</p>

<p>This is a project intended to compile Ruby programs so that they can be run on top of the Parrot virtual machine. It will convert the Ruby source into intermediate Compiler Code which will then be compiled and executed by Parrot.</p>

	<title>Charming Ruby Compiler</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/tw/resourcecatalog/Program-Development/Programming-Languages/ruby/Compiler/charming-ruby-compiler</link>
	<description><![CDATA[<p>
<p>The Charming Ruby Compiler is charming not just by name, but by nature. It's a thesis project at the Computer Science Department at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden to develop a proof of concept Ruby compiler that compiles to the C-- intermediate language. So far, they've only got the basics working, but it's an interesting project, if only to learn about C--, an interesting 'portable assembly language' that makes life easier for compiler developers. It seems a little like Parrot, and is funded by Microsoft Research and the National Science Foundation.</p>
